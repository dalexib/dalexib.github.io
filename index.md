    <h1>Dymen Barkins</h1>
    <p>
        I'm a graduate student at Rochester Institute of Technology, studying Human-Computer Interaction. I work as a Research Assitant with the Center for Accessibiltiy and Inclusion Research (CAIR) Lab  As technology becomes more and more integral to our everyday lives, I enjoy finding solutions and designing ways to make that integration more seamless and accessible.  I also have a keen interest in working with low-income and marginalized communities and exploring how to make technology more adaptable to their needs.

        When I'm not working or studying, I like to create art, whether it be digital or traditional, although I favor watercolors and graphite. I also enjoy studying new languages and linguistics. I'm currently learning Spanish and American Sign Language. I also dabble in a bit of cartography from time to time.

    <h2> Pixel Paper </h2>
    <p>I worked with a group to create an application to alleviate the issue that arose during the pivot from traditional instruction to remote learning. Conducted interviews, made personas, and designed an interface for the project.

    <p>In this project, I focused on steamlining and simplfying the current process of registering a vehicle. I also explored different options to fill out a form, instead of the traditional pen and paper method, that will hopefully speed up your visit to the DMV.
