    <p>
        I'm a graduate student at Rochester Institute of Technology, studying Human-Computer Interaction. I work as a Research Assitant with the Center for Accessibiltiy and Inclusion Research (CAIR) Lab  As technology becomes more and more integral to our everyday lives, I enjoy finding solutions and designing ways to make that integration more seamless and accessible.  I also have a keen interest in working with low-income and marginalized communities and exploring how to make technology more adaptable to their needs.

        When I'm not working or studying, I like to create art, whether it be digital or traditional, although I favor watercolors and graphite. I also enjoy studying new languages and linguistics. I'm currently learning Spanish and American Sign Language. I also dabble in a bit of cartography from time to time.
