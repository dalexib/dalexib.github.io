# FCU Redesign

## About
Online banking is becoming increasingly popular, however, many banking apps arenâ€™t the most visually appealing and at times can appear clunky and unfriendly. I redesigned the Empower Federal Credit Union app to make it more approachable and fun. I changed the color palette to a warmer tone and increased the size of the type to be readable by a larger range of individuals.
If I were to go back to this project, I would increase the contrast between the type and background color. I would also adjust the gradient to make it more subtle and create more screens to better illustrate the differences between the current and redesigned versions.
